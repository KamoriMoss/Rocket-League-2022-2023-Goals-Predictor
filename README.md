# Rocket League 2022-2023 Goals Predictor

Hello, I am Kamori Moss, a student at Georgia State University. I am a CIS major and this project is something I've created with my classmate Jekell Smith. The purpose of this project is to display to potential employers my usage of importing, cleaning, and preprocessing data, data splitting and training, modeling, evaluation, and creating visualizations for data. The project is a goal predictor for the popular video game Rocket League. If you are interested we also created a PowerPoint further detailing our findings this project serves as a display for our code.
